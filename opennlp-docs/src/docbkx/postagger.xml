		<title>Tagging</title>
		<para>
		The Part of Speech Tagger marks tokens with their corresponding word type
		based on the token itself and the context of the token. A token can have
		multiple pos tags depending on the token and the context. The OpenNLP POS Tagger
		uses a probability model to guess the correct pos tag out of the tag set.
		To limit the possible tags for a token a tag dictionary can be used which increases
		the tagging and runtime performance of the tagger.

		<title>POS Tagger Tool</title>

		The easiest way to try out the POS Tagger is the command line tool. The tool is only intended for demonstration and testing.
		Download the english maxent pos model and start the POS Tagger Tool with this command:

		The POS Tagger now reads a tokenized sentence per line from stdin.
		Copy these two sentences to the console:

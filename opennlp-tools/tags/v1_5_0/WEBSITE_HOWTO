This HOWTO describes how the opennlp website
can be updated.

The web site is in the "doc" directory. After modifying
the html files they must be pushed to the project web server
at sourceforge. All files in the doc directory
will be pushed, make sure there are only files which
should be part of the web site. 

The files will be deployed with maven. The login
credentials to the sourceforge server must be added
to the local settings.xml file in the maven .m2 folder.
Note, that is not inside the project folder and must
not be checked in!
Add the user and password to your local settings.xml file:

<settings>
  ...
  <servers>
        <server>
            <id>opennlp.sf.net</id>
            <username>testuser</username>
            <password>mysecretpwd</password>
            <filePermissions>775</filePermissions>
            <directoryPermissions>775</directoryPermissions>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>

If you are doing this the first time, the settings.xml file must
be created inside the maven .m2 folder.

Now follow these steps to actually update and deploy
the web site:
- Update the web site
- Verify the modifications with a browser
- Before deploying the site, commit the changes
  to the repository
- Create active shell with "ssh -t USER,opennlp@shell.sourceforge.net create"
  and logout with "exit"
- Deploy the site with mvn site:deploy

Files will only be added/updated, but never removed.
If you need to delete a file please use the unix shell,
the web site files can be found in this directory:
/home/groups/o/op/opennlp/htdocs

Model should be copied with scp.
First create an active shell, with the command from above
and then:
scp local.file USER,opennlp@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/o/op/opennlp/htdocs
